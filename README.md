## Full details of Project
--------------------------
### Project Title : Student-Parent Portal

### List of Group Members:
    1. Nayem Ahmed - 003
    2. Hajifa Begum Jui - 013
    3. Rayhan Ahmed - 025

### Objective:
    We would like to build a system where students can track their academic records such as results, also they can see status of various fees such as semester, monthly tuition etc and status shown as due, paid and so on. Good point is that, guardian of the students can also check the results, fees payments status as well. User will not need to wait for week to get results status, our system will fetch results within very short time.


### Features:
    1. Both parent and student can sign up, and sign in (Registerd user may have some other benefits such as notice board and academic calendar, upcoming events etc)
    2. User can check results within few moments
    3. User can track payment status for monthly tuition fees and semester fees.


### How it is related to University?
    In Metropolitan University, student have to send email to Onestop for their results and then wait until they manually check the results and then send a copy of it. Also student don't have any access to check there payment status. They have to go to account section and ask the accountant to check if they have any due, status of payment and so on. Our Student-parent Portal will bring automation in this issues. User can easily get there results and fees payment status by providing their studentship information.
